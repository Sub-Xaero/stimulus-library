To get started, you'll need to add the `stimulus-library` package to your project.

# Bundling
For NPM or Yarn users intending to bundle the library using Webpack, Vite, Rollup or similar, add `stimulus-library` to your package.json manually

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "stimulus-library": "latest"
  }
}
```

or run
`npm install --save stimulus-library` or `yarn add stimulus-library`

Then, to get started, import and register the controllers you want to use.

*Please Note* as below, that when registering the name for the controller, you should use `kebab-case` and omit the `-controller` suffix.

```js
import { Application } from "@hotwired/stimulus";
import { AutoSubmitFormController } from "stimulus-library";

const application = Application.start();
application.register("auto-submit-form", AutoSubmitFormController);
```

# Import Maps
For importmap users, you can add the following to your `config/importmap.rb` file:

```ruby
pin "date-fns/isPast", to: "https://unpkg.com/date-fns@latest/isPast.js"
pin "date-fns/formatDuration", to: "https://unpkg.com/date-fns@latest/formatDuration.js"
pin "date-fns/formatDistanceToNow", to: "https://unpkg.com/date-fns@latest/formatDistanceToNow.js"
pin "date-fns/toDate", to: "https://unpkg.com/date-fns@latest/toDate.js"
pin "date-fns/intervalToDuration", to: "https://unpkg.com/date-fns@latest/intervalToDuration.js"
pin "mitt", to: "https://unpkg.com/mitt@latest/dist/mitt.mjs"
pin "@stimulus-library/utilities", to: "https://unpkg.com/@stimulus-library/utilities@latest/dist/index.js"
pin "@stimulus-library/mixins", to: "https://unpkg.com/@stimulus-library/mixins@latest/dist/index.js"
pin "@stimulus-library/controllers", to: "https://unpkg.com/@stimulus-library/controllers@latest/dist/index.js"
pin "stimulus-library", to: "https://unpkg.com/stimulus-library@latest/dist/index.js"
```

You can also run `bin/importmap pin stimulus-library` to download the library and all its dependencies to your vendors directory and add them to the
importmap, but I have encountered issues with vendoring the `date-fns` library this way.

Then, in your `application.js` or similar file, import and register the controllers you want to use.

```js
import { Application } from "@hotwired/stimulus";
import { AutosizeController } from "stimulus-library"

application.register("autosize", AutosizeController)
```
