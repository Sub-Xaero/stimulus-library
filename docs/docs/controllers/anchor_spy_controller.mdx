## Purpose

A utility controller to detect and write anchors in the URL. i.e. "https://example.com#foo", the anchor is `foo`

When actions happen (i.e. an accordion opening) - write an anchor the URL that when revisited, would mean the accordion is reopened in the same place.

When the page loads with a matching anchor, fire events that can wire up other controllers. i.e. To reopen accordions/tabs when the page opens with the correct anchor.
