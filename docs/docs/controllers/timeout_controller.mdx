## Purpose

Utility controller to wire up other controller actions that need to fire after an elapsed time.

## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)

<NoActions/>

## [Targets](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/targets)

<NoTargets/>

## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)

<NoClasses/>

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seconds` | Number | The number of seconds until the action fires | - |

## Events

| Event | When | Dispatched on | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
|`timeout:action` | Fired after `secondsValue` seconds, used to wire your desired controller actions to | the controller root element | `element`: the controller root element |

## Side Effects

Calls `setTimeout` with the desired timeout. Cleans up on disconnect if that happens before timeout occurs.

# How to Use

An example: Show a marketing popup after 30 seconds.

```html
<div data-controller="popup dismissable" data-action="timeout:action->popup#open">
  <meta data-controller="timeout" data-timeout-seconds-value="30" />
  <p>Sign up to get great deals!</p>

  <a data-action="click->dismissable#dismiss">No thanks</a>
</div>
```
