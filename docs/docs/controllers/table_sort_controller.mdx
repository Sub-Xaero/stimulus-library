# How to Use

This is a fire-and-forget controller, there are no actions, targets or events to worry about. Just install it on your table and forget about it.

The controller expects a well-formed table, including a `<thead>` with one row of header cells, and `<tbody>` with all of your table data.

Once the controller is installed, users can sort table data by clicking on `<th>` cells in the table's header.

If `startSortValue` is set, the table will be sorted on load, otherwise the table will stay as it loaded until a user clicks on a column heading.

You can also set `data-sort-bottom` and `data-sort-top` attributes on `<tr>`s to pin a row to the top or bottom of the table.

# Notes & Limitations
- This controller cannot sort tables with inconsistent colspans. If your table has `<th>` and `<td>` with the same colspans, everything should work as expected, everything else is undefined.
- This controller also cannot sort tables with rowspans.
- When the table is sorted, rows are removed from the DOM and re-inserted into their new position - any custom properties or installed event listeners on the `<tr>` and `<td>` elements may be lost.
