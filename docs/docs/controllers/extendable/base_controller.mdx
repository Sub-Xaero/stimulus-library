| `isTurboPreview` | Whether or not the document is currently displaying a preview from the Hotwire/Turbo cache https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/building#detecting-when-a-preview-is-visible. Also works with legacy Turbolinks | `boolean` |
| `isTurbolinksPreview` | Alias for `isTurboPreview`, both methods work for both Turbolinks and Hotwire | `boolean` |

## Side Effects / Inherited Behaviour

If [debug mode](/docs/debugging) is enabled, any controller that extends BaseController controller will automatically log calls to any actions or methods, and events dispatched with `this.dispatch`.

If there are any getters, setters, methods or properties that should not be logged, you should name them with an underscore prefix i.e. `_foo() {}`, or `_bar = "baz"` to indicate that they are private methods.


## How to Use

```typescript
import {BaseController} from "stimulus-library";

export default class extends BaseController {
  // ...

 foo() {
   this.dispatch( this.el, "my-controller:something-happened", { bubbles: true, cancellable: true, detail: { element: this.el, data: 'thing' } } )
 }

}
```
