## Purpose

Track whether any of the inputs elements of a `<form>` have changed their value from the value they loaded with.

Adds `data-dirty` to any inputs being watched that change value, and removes `data-dirty` if it returns to its initial value.

Adds `data-dirty` to the form if any of the child inputs are different to the value they loaded with, and removes it when all elements are returned to their initial values.
