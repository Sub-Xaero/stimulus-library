## How to Use

There is nothing worse as an end user than filling out a long form, only to be bounced back and have to read back through the whole form to try and find where you missed a field.

If you add the controller and its elements to a header/footer/sticky widget/anywhere you like, when a form submission fails, you can use it as follows to allow the user to jump
back and forth between the fields that failed validation.

If you tell the controller about your `next`, `current` and/or `previous` target then controller will automatically disable and re-enable the buttons as the user hits the first/last error.

If the controller cannot find any errors using the provided selector, it will hide the controller root element using `display: none` so that the user is not shown buttons that do nothing.
