## How to Use

<iframe
  src="https:///stimulus-library.netlify.appcontrollers/async_block_controller.html"
  style={{width: "100%", height: "500px", border: "0", borderRadius: "4px", overflow: "hidden"}}
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"

The controller will send out a fetch request, and on success will replace the block with the HTML content of the response.
