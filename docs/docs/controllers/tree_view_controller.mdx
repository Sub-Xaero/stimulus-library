## Purpose

A controller that handles nested `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists, and enabled them to be collapsed and opened. i.e. file directories, lists of categories and sub-categories/items in those categories.

Fire and forget. The only configuration this controller takes is for the classes to apply to the lists to style them as active/collapsed.


## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)
<NoActions/>


## [Targets](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/targets)
<NoTargets/>


## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)

| Class | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `active` (Optional) | The class(es) that are applied when the list parent is 'open' | `active` |
| `collapsed` (Optional) | The class(es) that are appled when the list parent is 'closed' | `collapsed` |


## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)
<NoValues/>

## Events
<NoEvents/>

## Side Effects

The controller will `onclick` event handlers for every `<li>` that is a parent to a `<ul>` or `<ol>` element.

---

The controller will also install a MutationObserver that will observe the list for any changes, so that:
- elements that are added to the list and its subtree are handled correctly.
- any `<li>` elements that become new parents to a nested list have their handlers and classes installed.
- any `<li>` elements that are no longer parents to a nested list have their handlers and classes removed.
- elements that are removed from the list an its subtree are cleaned up correctly.
