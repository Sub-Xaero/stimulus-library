import NoTargets from "../_partials/no-targets.md";
import NoEvents from "../_partials/no-events.md";

## Purpose

To expand/show images in a lightbox view, for galleries or expanding thumbnails.


## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `open` | Creates and opens a `<dialog>`, with a copy of the given image. |
| `close` | Called automatically when the used presses `Esc` or clicks away from the `<dialog>`, but can be called manually to close and remove the `<dialog>` and cleanup. |

## [Targets](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/targets)
<NoTargets/>

## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)

| Class | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modal` (Optional) | The class(es) to apply to the created `<dialog>` element | `image-lightbox-dialog` |
| `image` (Optional)| The class(es) to apply to the `<img>` inside the `<dialog>` | `image-lightbox-image` |

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` (Optional) | String | If you wish to override the `src` given to the image rendered inside the `<dialogue>`  to be different to the `src` of the controller attached image | The `src` attribute of the controller element |
| `srcSet` (Optional) | String | If you wish to override the `srcSet` given to the image rendered inside the `<dialogue>`  to be different to the controller `srcSet` of the attached image | The `srcSet` attribute of the controller element |
| `sizes` (Optional) | String | If you wish to override the `sizes` given to the image rendered inside the `<dialogue>`  to be different to the `sizes` of the controller attached image | The `sizes` attribute of the controller element |

## Events
<NoEvents/>

## Side Effects

When the `open` action runs the controller will create a `<dialog>` element and insert it after the controller root element, and immediately open it.

There is also an event listener installed on the created `<dialog>` element to handle closing it when the user presses `Esc` or clicks away.



## How to Use

This controller needs to be mounted on an `<img>` tag to work.

On the `open` action - the controller will create a `<dialog>` element, insert it into the DOM after the controller root element, and immediately open it. You will want to style this according to your application, some examples are given below.
The `<dialog>` will have only one element inside of it, a new `<img>` with the `src`, `srcset` and `sizes` attributes either taken from the values API or copied from the controller root element.

This uses the [DialogPolyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill) library to make sure this behaviour is compatible with all browsers, but as such, is subject to the same limitations.

In particular - when styling the `::backdrop`(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) you will need to style both `dialog::backdrop` and `dialog + .backdrop` to account for the polyfilled behaviour.

### Warning

While in testing, this component has always performed perfectly - the polyfill mentioned above warns that if you experience issues with stacking contexts, and the dialogue not properly rendering at the topmost Z-Index, it is likely due to your browser having poor support for `<dialog>` and this library being able
to fully mock the behaviour. [See the limitations section of DialogPolyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill#limitations) for more
information.
