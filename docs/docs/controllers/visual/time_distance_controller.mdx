## Purpose

A controller that displays the distance in words between the specified time and the current time. Works for both past and future dates.

Inspired by https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper/distance_of_time_in_words, but updates in real time.

Implemented using https://date-fns.org/v2.21.1/docs/intervalToDuration, wrapped in intelligent timing code that automatically works out how often to update the API.

Fire and forget. The only configuration this controller takes is the timestamp.

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value       | Type   | Description                                                           | Default |
|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `timestamp` | String | The UNIX timestamp in seconds of the date/time to show "time ago" for | -       |

## Events
<NoEvents/>

## Side Effects

The controller will set increasingly infrequent timeouts using `setTimeout` according to the distance to the timestamp in `timestampValue`. As the time gets further away, the controller updates the text lest frequently.

- If the timestamp was seconds/minutes ago, the controller will set timeouts to update the text every ~30 seconds.
- If the timestamp was hours ago, the controller will set timeouts to update the text every ~30 minutes.
- If the timestamp was days or more ago, the controller will not set any timeouts.

All timeouts are cleaned up when the controller disconnects.
