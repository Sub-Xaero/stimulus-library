| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `save` | Save the contents of the form to localstorage |
| `restore` | Restore the form to its previous state from localstorage |
| `clear` | Clear any saved state from localstorage |

<NoTargets/>

## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)
<NoClasses/>

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | The unique ID of this form on the page. This combined with the current URL will allow multiple forms on the same page to all save.  | The ID of the controller root element, or throw an error an ID is not found and this is not specified |
| `restoreOnLoad` | `Boolean` | Whether the controller should try to restore any previous state when the controller connects | true |
| `clearOnSubmit` | `Boolean` | Whether the controller should clean out the saved value when the form submits | true |

## Events

| Event | When | Dispatched on | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `form-save:cleared` | When the form is cleared, either by `submit` or when triggered by an action | The controller root element (the form) | - |
| `form-save:save:success` | When the form saves successfully | The controller root element (the form) | - |
| `form-save:restore:success` | When the form restores values successfully | The controller root element (the form) | - |
| `form-save:restore:empty` | When a restore is triggered, but there is nothing in localstorage to restore | The controller root element (the form) | - |



## Side Effects

If  the `clearOnSubmit` value is set to `true`, a `submit` event listener will be installed on the form.
