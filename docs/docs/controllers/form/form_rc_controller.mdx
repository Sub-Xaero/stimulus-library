## Purpose

Submit and/or reset a form, using links/buttons that are outside the child DOM of the form.


## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reset` | Reset the form |
| `submit` | Submit the form |

## [Targets](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/targets)

| Target | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `form` (Optional) | The form to target the controller's actions on | - |

## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)
<NoClasses/>

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `formSelector` (Optional) | String | The CSS selector to find the form to remotely submit/reset | - |
| `submitMode` (Optional) | String | The mode to submit the form using, either `direct` or `request`. <br/><br/>`direct` calls `.submit()` on the form without dispatching the `submit` event. <br/>`request` synthesizes a normal `submit` event on the form, a submit event will still be fired and any listeners that modify the behaviours of the form will still run.<br/><br/>  | `request` |


## Events

| Event | When | Dispatched on | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `submit` [Native Browser Event] | When the form is submitted, via the `submit` action | The `form` target. | - |
| `reset` [Native Browser Event] | When the form is reset, via the `reset` action | The `form` target. | - |

## Side Effects

- Adds event listeners for `change` or `input` (depending on the value of `eventModeValue`) to all `<input>` `<textarea>` and `<select>` elements in the controller's scope.
- If the `submitModeValue` is `request` and the browser does not support `.requestSubmit()`, then the controller will use any existing submit buttons, or create a hidden submit button (which will be cleaned up on 'disconnect'), to submit the form by clicking on them.

## How to Use

### Option 1:
Put the controller in a scope that can see a `formTarget`, and wire up some links with actions to `form-rc#submit`,

### Option 2:
Put the controller in a scope with some links with actions to `form-rc#submit`, and a CSS selector
provided to the controller via `formSelectorValue` that it can use to find the form in the page,
