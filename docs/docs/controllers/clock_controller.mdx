## Purpose

A controller that displays a clock of the current time.


## [Actions](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/actions)
<NoActions/>


## [Targets](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/targets)

| Target | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hours` (Optional) | The target to display the current hour | - |
| `minutes` (Optional) | The target to display the current minute | - |
| `seconds` (Optional) | The target to display the current second | - |
| `milliseconds` (Optional) | The target to display the current millisecond | - |


## [Classes](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/classes)
<NoClasses/>


## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)
<NoValues/>

## Events
<NoEvents/>

## Side Effects

The controller will set an interval using `setInterval`.
The frequency of the interval depends on what targets are present. The interval will be as frequent as needed to update the fastest unit that a target is present for. i.e. When milliseconds are present, the interval will be 1ms. When only hours are present, the interval will update every 5 minutes.
Cleans up on disconnect.

## How to Use

Specify the targets that you require to display the clock as you would like it.

See the `styles.css` in the sandbox/demo for how to control the presentation of the clock.
