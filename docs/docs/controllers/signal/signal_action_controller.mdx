## Purpose

A controller that responds to SignalInputController notifications. This controller trigger actions on other stimulus controllers
based on the expression given in `whenValue`, which it will use to evaluate the value of the input.
based on changes to inputs and their values.

This controller can be anywhere in the DOM tree and it will receive notifications from any SignalInputController with
the same `nameValue` as the `nameValue` of this controller.

## [Values](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/reference/values)

| Value | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | The name of the input value whose value to react to. This name should be the same as the `nameValue` of the SignalInputController you want to sync with.  | `-` |
| `when` | String | A simple _expression_ which will be evaluated against the value received from SignalInputController. If the expression evaluates to true, the controller will emit a `match` event. If the expression evaluates to false, the controller will emit a `no-match` event. | `-` |

## Events

| Event | When | Dispatched on | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `signal:match:${nameValue}` | When value of the input for `nameValue` changes, and the expression in `showValue` evaluates to _true_ against the new updated value | The controller root element | `element`: the controller root element,<br/><br/> `value`: the changed value |
| `signal:no-match:${nameValue}` | When value of the input for `nameValue` changes, and the expression in `showValue` evaluates to _false_ against the new updated value | The controller root element | `element`: the controller root element,<br/><br/> `value`: the changed value |

## How to Use

```html

<input type="number" name="foo" data-controller="signal-input">

<div
  data-controller="signal-action bar"
  data-signal-action-name-value="foo"
  data-signal-action-when-value="=3 || =5"
  data-action="signal:match:foo->bar#fizzBuzz"
>
  <!-- bar controller's `fizzBuzz` action is called when the value of input[name="foo"] is 3 or 5 -->
</div>

```
