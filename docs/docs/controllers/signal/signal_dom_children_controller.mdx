## Purpose

A controller that listens for changes to the elements that are children/contents/descendents of the element that it is mounted on,
and emits a count of the number of elements that are in the child tree to any other Signal controllers that have subscribed by referencing
the same `nameValue` as this controller.

The emitted value can then be used in expressions in other `Signal*` controllers to enable more complex interactions.

A common use case for this would be to use this controller in conjunction with the `SignalVisibilityController`to show
a blank slate message like "You don't have any posts, create one now!" when there are no results on a page, and hide it again when items arrive.
Particularly in contexts where contents of a container can arrive and be removed remotely VIA Server-Sent-Events, AJAX,
TurboStreams, Websockets and even Third-Party JS interactions with the page.

Other use cases might be to show or hide elements when there is a specific number of items in the child tree, or greater than a certain number.

| Value                      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Default                                           |
|----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                     | String | The name/key to send signals using. This name should be the same as the `nameValue` of the other SignalControllers you want to sync with.                                    | `-`                                               |
| `scopeSelector` (Optional) | String | A CSS selector to pass to `querySelectorAll` to limit what elements are included in the count of empty/not-empty. You can use this to ignore certain elements from the count | All child elements of the controller root element |

## Events
| Event                       | When                                         | Dispatched on               | `event.detail` |                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| `signal:value:#{nameValue}` | When the value of the attached input changes | The controller root element | `value`        | The new value of the input |

## How to Use

```html

    <div data-controller="signal-dom-children" data-demo-target="output" data-signal-dom-children-name-value="notifications">
      <!-- Notifications are put into this element by websockets, or a third-party library.  -->
      <!-- Notifications can be dismissed by clicking "X", which simply removes them from the DOM. -->
      <!-- We don't need to call any methods, fire any events, or reference any controllers directly -->
      <!-- The controller will emit a signal when elements are added or removed, and inform any listening controllers with the same `nameValue` of how many elements there are -->
    </div>

    <div
      class="alert alert-success my-4"
      data-controller="signal-visibility"
      data-signal-visibility-name-value="notifications"
      data-signal-visibility-show-value="<=0"
    >
      <!-- This message will only show when there are zero notifications -->
      Well done! You've reached inbox zero.
      Make yourself a cup of tea, you deserve it.
    </div>
