## Purpose

Controller for adding 'copy-to-clipboard' functionality to a link/button/etc, with support for progressive enhancement.

If 'copy' is supported, the controller will select the contents of the given input and execute a "copy".

If 'copy' is NOT supported by the browser the controller will simply select the contents of the given input for the user to be able to copy manually.

You can also wire up the controller to have a copy button, and an optional fallback button (i.e. "Select this text") to show if clipboard controls are not supported by the user's browser. Setting the `removeUnused` value to `true` will make the controller remove whichever target is unused.
